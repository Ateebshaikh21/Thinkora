✅ VERCEL CONFIGURATION FIXED!

I've updated the vercel.json file and pushed it to GitHub.

🔄 NOW DO THIS:

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard

2. Click on your "thinkora" project

3. Click "Deployments" tab

4. You should see it's automatically redeploying with the new config!

5. Wait 2-3 minutes for the build to complete

---

IF IT DOESN'T AUTO-REDEPLOY:

1. Click the "..." menu on the latest deployment
2. Click "Redeploy"
3. Make sure "Use existing Build Cache" is UNCHECKED
4. Click "Redeploy"

---

✅ THE FIX:

I simplified the vercel.json configuration to:
- Build command: cd frontend && npm install && npm run build
- Output directory: frontend/dist
- Framework: vite
- Rewrites for SPA routing

This should work now!

⚠️ DON'T FORGET:

Add this environment variable in Vercel:
- Name: VITE_API_URL
- Value: https://thinkora-backend.onrender.com/api

Go to: Settings → Environment Variables → Add

Your app should be live in 2-3 minutes! 🎉
